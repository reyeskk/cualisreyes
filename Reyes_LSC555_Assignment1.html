<h1><a href="https://www.fcpl.org/" target="_blank">Frederick County Public Library (FCPL)</a></h1>

<h2>System Introduction</h2>
<p>Frederick County Public Library (FCPL) is a public library system serving the residents of Frederick County Maryland. In addition to its extensive catalog of books and media, FCPL offers diverse programs and digital resources that connect, educate, and enrich the community.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>The Frederick County Public Library system operates nine branches across the county. According to FCPL’s strategic plan, its vision is to foster an informed, empowered, and vibrant community. The core values that support this vision are kindness, listening, connection, and creativity. FCPL notes that tax dollars provide for buildings, books, and staff, which ensures the libraries remain open and accessible to the public while also accepting donations and volunteer support.</p>

<h3>Users</h3>
<p>FCPL’s mission includes meeting people where they are, expanding access, fostering individual and community growth, and creating welcoming spaces. In carrying this mission, FCPL serves audiences of all ages, from babies to seniors, through programs designed for different groups and needs. Academic resources such as Gale support students and scholars, while community outreach partnerships provide a bridge to resources and collaborate on shared programs for the community, as listed on their calendar.</p>

<h3>Content</h3>
<p>While many programs are open to the public, access to materials such as databases, ebooks, and streaming services requires a library card. Physical collections include books, Playaways, DVDs, magazines, and reference materials. Digital resources such as Hoopla, Libby, and Kanopy for ebooks, audiobooks, and music or film streaming. Academic resources such as Gale, Brainfuse, or reference databases like Salem Health support students and scholars. For historians and genealogists, FCPL also provides access to ancestry and genealogy databases, while the Maryland Room hosts a significant archive collection focused on local history.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<p>The homepage has accessible dropdown menu options that are easy to understand and make it simple to find information quickly. The site appears to follow the “three-click rule,” allowing users to navigate to their desired content without difficulty. Within the catalog, FCPL highlights rotating curated collections tied to monthly or inclusive themes, such as R.L. Stine, Hispanic Heritage Month, and Building Bridges, alongside regular updates on new fiction and nonfiction. At the bottom of the page, a kid-friendly interface provides a colorful, image-based way for children to explore subjects of interest. The main tabs and menus also clearly show that FCPL offers more than books, including services like passport applications and a comprehensive program calendar listing events across all branches. In addition, the library integrates access to external resources by embedding hyperlinks to databases and digital platforms such as Gale, Hoopla, Libby, and Kanopy directly into its website, making it simple for users to connect with these tools through their library card. Resources such as the Maryland Deaf Culture Digital Library reflect FCPL’s commitment to inclusivity and accessibility, demonstrating the system’s technological support for diverse community needs. Finally, FCPL also supports MARINA, Maryland’s statewide interlibrary loan system, which provides a direct portal for patrons to request and borrow materials from libraries across the state.</p>

<h3>Suggestions for Improvement</h3>
<p>While FCPL’s system is generally strong, several adjustments could make it even more effective for users. The program calendar would benefit from branch-specific filters or tabs, which would save patrons from having to scroll through a long consolidated list of events. Adjusting the bright white background, either by softening the palette or offering a dark mode option, would reduce eye strain and improve accessibility. Finally, aligning the Marina interlibrary load portal with other external resources by having it open in a new tab would prevent disruptions to the main FCPL site and create a smoother, more consistent experience.</p>
